# Dashboard Layout Ideas

- Implement a persistent sidebar navigation to replace the current tab bar so key sections are always one click away.
- Introduce a responsive card grid on the main dashboard summarizing key metrics (e.g., active staff, current term, recent activity).
- Add a collapsible activity feed or notifications panel to highlight recent actions and pending approvals.
- Consider a light/dark theme toggle and consistent color palette to improve readability and modernize the appearance.
- Use larger touch-friendly buttons with clear iconography for common actions like adding students or terms.
- Reserve a top header bar for global actions (search, user profile) while keeping content sections focused on data and forms.
